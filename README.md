## Typography CSS properties

* font-size (learn the diffrence between PX and EM)
* font-weight (number between 300-900)
* line-height (set the natural height of the element)
* letter-spacing (use very sparingly)

Its important to use h1-h6 throughout the site. This is considered good SEO practice. 

Headers default with top/bottom margin and a bold font-weight. It is important to keep this in mind if you don't want them.

## Positioning CSS properties

* float: left/right 
Sometimes this comes in handy, but please try to stay away from using it. It removes elements from the flow of the site and is considered pretty hacky.
* position: relative/absolute/static/fixed
Very powerful when you figure out how to use them. Allows you to use top/bottom/left/right to push elements one way or the other. This article is a bit long, but it explains this property well [CSS Positioning 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101)
* display: block/inline/inline-block
This might fix a random error you have. It's important to understand what an element's default display property is. Headers and divs are display: block. Images and links are display:inline. Inline-block elements appear as inline elements but act as block elements. Inline elements don't allow margin.
